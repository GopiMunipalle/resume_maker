  sectionHeading1: "1. Choose a Clean and Professional Layout",
  sectionContent1:
    "A well-organized and clean layout will make your resume stand out to employers. Use clear headings, bullet points, and a consistent font. Avoid over-cluttered sections. Make sure the most important information is easy to read at a glance.",
  sectionHeading2: "2. Focus on Results, Not Just Responsibilities",
  sectionContent2:
    "Employers want to know what impact youâ€™ve made. Instead of just listing your job duties, emphasize quantifiable achievements. For example, 'Increased sales by 30% in the first quarter' or 'Led a team of 5 developers to create an application that improved process efficiency by 25%.'",
  sectionHeading3: "3. Tailor Your Resume for Each Job Application",
  sectionContent3:

  sectionHeading4: "4. Keep It Short and Concise",
  sectionContent4:
    "Your resume should ideally be one page (two pages if you have over 10 years of experience). Be concise and avoid adding irrelevant information. Focus on your most impressive achievements and skills that make you a great fit for the role.",
  sectionHeading5: "5. Use Action Verbs and Specific Language",
  sectionContent5:
    "Use action verbs like Managed, Developed, Created, Led, Improved, etc., to demonstrate your accomplishments. Use specific numbers or data to make your statements more compelling.",
  sectionHeading6: "6. Proofread and Edit Your Resume",
  sectionContent6:
    "Always proofread your resume before submitting it. Typos and grammatical errors can hurt your chances of landing an interview. Consider asking a trusted friend or mentor to review it as well.",
